The core difference lies in how `removeIf` and `removeAll` modify the list.  `removeIf` modifies the list in place, so it is a void function that alters the original list, whereas `removeAll` returns a boolean value representing the outcome of the operation rather than modifying the list directly. Using `removeIf` when you expect to directly modify the list is correct; however, you may need to use a different approach altogether depending on the use case. For instance, if you need to maintain the original list, you could create a copy using `toList()` before applying `removeIf` or `removeAll`.
